"""Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).

A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `python3`, `pip`, `uv` or `uvx` without actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python
gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24 and Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below
the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices, because a job that names no version has nothing to
read. This is a port of the website's check (scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in HCW-HybridCloudWorks). `uv` and
`uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the interpreter it finds, the runner's own unless one was set up; so
astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only when it is given a `python-version` at or above the floor.

A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a backtick,
`(`, `{`, `|`, `&` or `;`, after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`), after leading `NAME=value`
assignments (the value plain text, a quoted string, or both run together), or after a word that runs the next one
(`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `!`, `if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's options (`sudo -u
nobody`, `env -i`). It counts with a path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`), because a path to the
runner's interpreter is still the runner's, and `python3.15.2` counts like `python3`. It does not count in a comment, a
heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted string runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or a backtick; a
single-quoted one may run over several lines, as a `docker run image bash -c '...'` script does) or as an argument
(`docker run image python ...`, or the first word of a line that continues the one before it). The set-up step must come
before the first such step. Limits, on purpose: a job that runs in a `container:` uses that image's runtime and is not
checked; and a script a step calls (a `.sh` file) is not read.

A set-up step with its own `if:` may be skipped while a later command still runs on the runner's own interpreter
(Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100), so it covers a later step only when that step's `if:` is the same condition,
or is one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||` (whenever that step runs, so did the
set-up). Conditions are compared without a surrounding `${{ }}`, with runs of spaces made one, and a term without
one pair of parentheses around the whole of it. A set-up step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition
does not test the job's status. A job's own `if:` does not matter here, because it decides whether every step of the
job runs, alike.

The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a step's
condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step has
failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#72). So after each job status (success, a failure, a cancel) a later step may run after,
its set-up step must surely run, or depend on the same thing by the rule above, applied to the conditions with their
status-only `&&` terms taken out. `||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs after
success and failure, not after a cancel.

Each set-up step must also ask for the floor or newer (Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81): `python-version` or
`python-version-file`, `node-version` or `node-version-file`, read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or
workflow's `env:`), `${{ matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix list) and the named file. A version that names a
line only (`26`, `26.x`, `3.15`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the
floor's; an exact version (`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`,
`26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming
the step, rather than passing unchecked.

The workflows are read with a small line reader rather than a YAML library, because none is a dependency here. It
relies on the layout every workflow in this repository has (a `jobs:` key at the top level, a `steps:` list, block
`run: |` scripts, `with:` and `env:` written `{ ... }` or as indented `key: value` lines); a file it cannot read that
way fails the test rather than being skipped.
